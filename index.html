    <h1>Recipes that I attempted</h1>
    <p>Welcome to "recipes that I attempted"! On this website, the anonymous writer of the site shares a few
        recipes that they attempted to cook before, and have either completely botched or came up with a dish
        that was not exactly up to par.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Below you will find the recipes that they have attempted. 
            The steps and Ingredients provided are (usually) taken from the exact cookbook that the writer used. </p>
           <ul> The recipes:
            <li><a href="./recipes/cookies.html">Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies</a></li> 
            <li><a href="./recipes/friedchicken.html">Crispy Fried Chicken</a></li>
